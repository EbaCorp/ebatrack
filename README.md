# EBA Track (Core Library)
UI Tracking application written in JavaScript.

## TODO:
- Add Dashboard UI with all the stats (out of scope)
-- Create stats visual representation (consider using `D3.js`)
- Make page snapshot with heat map (out of scope)
- Consider making this application as a `Node.js` package
